# Determining the best VR platform

## Project
This project involves building a VR application that allows users to "tour" an accurate reconstruction of an ancient Roman city. Users will also be able to interact with 3D models of real artifacts from the site, developed through 3D scanning and photogrammetry technologies.

The anticipated audience for this project is academic researchers, students, and people with an interest in ancient history.

Westerfield is a professor and academic researcher who studies human societies in ancient Mesopotamia, and is inspired by the potential of VR to provide new ways to understand, visualize and interact with these societies. He has demoed custom VR applications developed by colleagues that allow users to walk through reconstructed cities and inspect ancient artifacts that are not available to the public. He is very interested in learning more about emerging VR tools and methods to support the digital humanities.

## Determining the best VR Platform
Westerfield is a professional at an institution of higher education with a respectable budget for academic technology so all VR platforms would potentially be available to him for his use and research. However, his undergraduate students may have more limited access to the more expensive platforms, such as the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive--these would likely need to be made available to them.

This particular project would require a lot of interactivity--users would need to be able to navigate through the reconstructed city and also interact with artifacts (e.g. pick them up, increase/decrease the size of the artifacts for examination, change colors, measure, etc.) through the use of controllers. This would be designed as a very immersive experience--users would be active participants in the experience rather than passive viewers.

The visuals also need to be high-quality in order to be realistic. For the artifacts, in particular, we would need high-poly 3D models to display the details, potentially mapped over lower-poly models that would be used for the colliders users would interact with through the controllers.

Given these requirements, the best platforms currently available for this application would be either the HTC Vive or Oculus Rift.
