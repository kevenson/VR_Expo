### Examples
##### Intro:
Welcome to my virtual reality expo. This application was designed to showcase the many educational applications of virtual reality, with an emphasis on higher education. Use the cursor to click on the blue waypoints in order to explore this small campus quad and learn about some of the applications of virtual reality in the Digital Humanities, Social Sciences, and Natural Sciences in colleges and universities around the globe.

There are also two additional spaces to your right where you can learn about some of the primary applications for virtual reality in K-12 schools and for online learning.

Enjoy your stay!

1. VR in Digital Humanities
> Simulations/reconstructions,
> VR Sculpture, digitized installations

Virtual reality has many applications in the Digital Humanities. For example, an increasing number of researchers are using 3D modeling and VR tools to develop digital reconstructions of ancient structures or even entire cities that can be experienced in virtual reality. The [Virtual Rome](https://research.reading.ac.uk/virtualrome/) project designed by Dr. Matthew Nicholls of the University of Reading is one example of this, and you can see a simple demonstration by clicking on the demo theater model in front of you.

Another example of the application of virtual reality in the Digital Humanities comes from the arts. Artists can now use digital tools like [Medium](https://www.oculus.com/medium/) to create virtual sculptures or other art forms that can be viewed and shared in virtual reality, potentially making them more accessible to a broader audience. Moreover, physical galleries or art installations can also be digitized and made available in virtual reality with tools like the [Matterport Pro camera](https://matterport.com/), such as the piece by the artist Jackie Brown of Bowdoin College that you can view with the photosphere on the table in front of you.

2. VR in Natural Sciences

The Natural Sciences have many potential use cases for virtual reality. In mathematics and physics there are a growing number of applications designed to help students learn math in a more natural environment or visualize complicated geometries in an immersive environment. For example, the [HandWaver application](https://umaine.edu/imre/handwaver/) created by researchers at the University of Maine for the HTC Vive, was designed to allow users to "use their hands to act on mathematical figures directly, without mediating their intuitions through equations, keyboards, or mouse movements" (source: https://umaine.edu/imre/handwaver/).

Another example comes from [Hyperbolic VR](http://elevr.com/portfolio/hyperbolic-vr/), where Henry Segerman and Elisabetta Matsumoto have created a virtual reality application that allows users to experience non-Euclidian spaces, or spaces with geometries in which parallel lines can intersect or veer apart. You can see an example of this type of space in the image in front of you.

Yet another example is using VR tools to allow students and researchers to view and manipulate complex molecular structures, such as the HIV virus molecule on the table in front of you, as you can now easily do online with [Autodesk's great Molecule Viewer](https://moleculeviewer.lifesciences.autodesk.com/).

3. VR in Social Sciences
> VR labs, simulations, data viz,

In the Social Sciences, virtual reality can be used for a wide variety of applications. For example, in disciplines that make use of statistics and data modeling, like economics and sociology, VR can be used for innovative forms of data visualization, as you can see in the image in front of you. Work in this area is still in an early stage, but immersive virtual data modeling techniques provided by applications like [datavizVR](https://www.datavizvr.com/) by 3Data may make it easier to visualize Big Data sets.

Additionally, similar to applications in the Natural Sciences, in fields like Anthropology and Archaeology that make use of laboratories, virtual reality can be used in conjunction with modern 3D scanners or photogrammetry to create VR labs that enable users to examine and manipulate fragile or inaccessible artifacts, such as the Homo Habilis skull image you can see in front of you.

Moreover, because everything in a virtual environment can be tracked and analyzed virtual reality technologies can be used to develop potentially game-changing research for fields like psychology into human perception and interaction.

4. VR in K-12
tours, google expeditions, mathematics, etc.

Virtual reality has many of the same applications in K-12 as it does in higher education. For example, the applications designed to help students learn math discussed in the Natural Sciences station would also benefit many K-12 learners. Similarly, many K-12 students would also benefit from the ability to participate in virtual laboratories where they can interact with objects or artifacts that may not be available to them in physical form or even dangerous materials that need to be restricted.

However, one major issue with bringing virtual reality to K-12 classrooms is the cost. Higher-end virtual reality applications, such as those discussed in the higher education stations, typically require expensive headsets with controllers, like the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive, in addition to powerful gaming computers to run them. Moreover, at this point, much of the educational content needs to be created for a specific class or use-case which requires highly-skilled developers. This increases the cost and can make virtual reality a difficult sell in K-12 schools, which typically have to contend with strict budgetary constraints.

While these costs will likely drop as the technology matures, some companies are still designing affordable hardware and content specifically for K-12 schools. For example, [Google Expeditions](https://edu.google.com/expeditions/#header) runs on the affordable Google Cardboard platform and was designed to help teachers bring their students on expeditions or field trips to locations ranging from Antarctica to the International Space Station. As seen on the image in front of you, Google Expeditions can be used simultaneously with an entire classroom of students, with the teacher driving the content through a tablet.


5. VR for online learning

Researchers and practitioners have been interested in using virtual reality technologies to construct collaborative environments for online learning since the [early 2000's](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.457.4283&rep=rep1&type=pdf). In this type of environment, students from all over the world can learn, work together, and even socialize in an immersive virtual environment that may provide access to educational experiences and [objects-to-think-with](http://learning.media.mit.edu/content/publications/EA.Piaget%20_%20Papert.pdf) that would not otherwise be available.

More recently, researchers have been looking into [how virtual reality might be incorporated into Massive Open Online Courses](http://www.centerdigitaled.com/blog/immersive-virtual-reality-online-education-for-the-next-generation.html), or MOOCs, as a potential way to increase student interaction and, hopefully, course completion. One of the biggest companies in this area right now is not even an educational company. [Facebook's new Spaces social VR platform](https://www.facebook.com/spaces), which allows users to interact using avatars in a virtual space, as you can see in the image in front of you, is one of the more sophisticated platforms available today.

Two of the biggest challenges for this application of VR have been how you build a VR environment for students and instructors that allows for synchronous collaboration and how you make the tools necessary to use such an environment, such as high-end head-mounted displays and controllers--available to more users.



# IF TIME:
